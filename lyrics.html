        [Verse 1]
        Stockade! So smart, so you think You hey, you're a nappy pain my darling
        Just wait! I don’t know a thing
        No way this is fair, you're bitter to me
        
        [Verse 2]
        The peasant's willful wishes waste like scraps of irony
        A cold, congruent, contract, kept alive in reverie
        Where no one knows the numbers next in line or where to go
        That sort of edging, eager, virgin happy show
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        I don’t have a single new request to ask of you 
        It's the same as ever, watch your back no warning warning 
        Taking all my stress, there's only just one thing to do 
        Brace yourself for all my love's attack now
        
        [Chorus]
        Left side, right side
        Bear your fangs it's time to fight
        Pa-pa-pa
        Parade in shame tonight
        Left side, right side
        Bear your fangs and come alive
        Pa-pa-pa
        Haha
        YOU ARE KING YOU ARE KING
        (I'm the king)

        [Verse 3]
        Acting oh so innocent
        You are my sin, my darling darling
        Laughing out so cool again
        All of the pain is blown to bits
        Clumsily I'II d*e and then
        All of the joy is all that's left my
        Lo-Lo-Love oh, ra-ta-ta
        Filling with hate I cry, I’m breaking down
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        Once again I have a new request to ask of you
        It’s the same as ever, watch your back no warning warning 
        Taking all my stress, there's only just one thing to do 
        Brace yourself for all my love’s attack now
        
        [Chorus]
        Left side, right side
        Bear your fangs it's time to fight
        Pa-pa-pa
        Parading out of sight
        Left side, right side
        Bear your fangs and come alive
        Pa-pa-pa
        Haha
        YOU ARE KING YOU ARE KING
        YOU ARE KING</pre>
